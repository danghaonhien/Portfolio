        <h4>Understanding the problem</h4>
        <p>
          Training a sport is an act of repetition, doing the same moves over
          and over again until you master them. Therefore, precision in body
          movements is one of the key to become a better athlete. For someone
          with little to no experience of the sport, it is overwhelming to
          spend time practicing with little improvements because he or she
          does not understand the correct body movements.

          </h4>
          <p>
            Table tennis is one of the sports that require extreme precision in body movements which will be a perfect
            example why we need to use Codi device and app. Therefore, I choose this sport to
            conduct 3 user interviews with people who have different levels of experience with table tennis and using
            Codi device. My
            research goals were:
          <ul>
            <li>To understand why players keep making common mistakes. </li>
            <li> To explore how difficult for a player to master a basic stroke.</li>
            <li>To discover if they use any apps to help them achieve their goals</li>

            Talking to people playing ping pong with Codi device gave me a good understanding of their needs & goals. I
            gathered useful insights and started to narrow down the scope of the project. I created 2 distinct user
            personas:
          <ul>
            <li> <b>The Beginner</b> : representing users with little to no experience in playing ping pong who need

            <li> <b>The Pro</b> : representing users with lots of experience who are primarily interested in inspiring
              others with his excellent skill moves. Main focus: Seeking Inspiration.</li>

        <h4>What to design first?
        </h4>
        <p>
          From the initial research, the user personas & user flows I identified three main features of the app:

        <ul>
          <li>Sync the recorded training from Codi device
          </li>
          <li> Review detailed analysis

          <li>Save the moves into user’s customized library</li>

      </article>
     
      <article >
      
        <p>
          Talking to potential users at different ping pong clubs, it became clear that some folks prefer to use their personal smart phone when reviewing their fitness/sport performance such as Apple Fitness App. Reflecting on this need, my fellow designer have started working on a Mobile version simultaneously. I adopted a Desktop approach when considering key features to be designed in the first MVP of Codi.  I composed a plan of what the desktop version will include in terms of features and functionality & how they will build up on the mobile version.

        <h4>Reconstructing Information Architecture
        </h4>
        <p>
          What motivated me to reconstruct the primary features was not only the results from the Open Card Sort but also the wrong assumption about how to learn to play table tennis. I made a mistake assuming every player would learn the same way; however, I totally forgot that different player has different builds such as body type, play style, or personal traits. There saw another oppotunity for a unique value proposition: Personalization feature to get the better recommendation that match each individual for the moves.

        <h4>Design strategies & Visual inspirations
        </h4>
        <p>
          Codi is about precision, energy, motion and positivity. In order to express the feeling of Codi, I have discussed with the project manager, developers and CEO about the color themes by providing visual inspirations. Body motions, UI elements and typography are the primary focus of the dashboard. Therefore, we come up the idea of dark theme paired with neon contrast colors where it could speak a more powerful language to the users. We have switched the original neon orange of Codi to a neon green because we believe it is a more energetic approach.
          <p>I used the Visual Inspirations, Moodboard and Style Tiles  library as a starting point and developed a more detailed Design Language document such as Logo Redevelopment, UI elements. It’s purpose is to ensure consistency and communicate the language of Codi to our stakeholders.</p>
